<p><strong>Overview</strong><p>

<p>Museum goers are usually very observant and are taken through a wave of emotions as they move from one piece to the next, but they seem to leave all these thoughts at the Museum door when they exit the exhibition. This can result as a combination of different factors: absence of a dedicated audience for their views, inaccessibility of good quality images for illustrative purposes, and sometimes its just inability to find pieces that appeal enough to them to make a felt experiential reaction. The Gallery aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for people to share their thoughts about Art and making sure they have interesting Art to talk about right at their fingertips by giving them timely and targeted recommendations to Museum exhibitions.</p>
