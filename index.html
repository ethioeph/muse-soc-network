<p><strong>Overview</strong><p>

<p>Museum goers are usually very observant and are taken through a wave of emotions as they move from one piece to the next, but they seem to leave all these thoughts at the Museum door when they exit the exhibition. This can result as a combination of different factors: absence of a dedicated audience for their views, inaccessibility of good quality images for illustrative purposes, and sometimes its just inability to find pieces that appeal enough to them to make an emotional impact. The Gallery aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for people to share their thoughts about Art and making sure they have interesting Art to talk about right at their fingertips by giving them timely and targeted recommendations to Museum exhibitions.</p>

<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong><br>
After extensive context-based research, our team concluded that users need a way to access High Quality photos of museum artwork.  Introducing, The Gallery: an app that allows users to have digital access to artwork, directly from their mobile phone.  By adding their own commentary, and sharing these pieces with friends, family, and the world, users are able to engage in the discussions theyâ€™ve always wanted to!
</p>   

<p><strong>Key Functionality</strong>
   <ul>
      <li> <strong>Bringing Discussion Outside of The Museum</strong> <br> The main objective of The Gallery is to allow users to engage in discussions about art, Anywhere, Anytime.  We solve this issue by allowing users to access High Quality versions of artwork from digitized collections available online by museums- images that users will actually <em>want</em> to share.  Then, we allow users to add their own commentary to their posts, and engage in discussions in the comment sections of their own, their friends', and popular public posts.  The Gallery connects the museum-going world, from anywhere in the world!</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Recommendations to Users</strong> <br> Based on user preferences, past experiences, engagement, etc., The Gallery helps to ensure users are able to find new museums and exhibits that are best-suited for them. Engaging in art is fun, but it can be hard to keep up with constantly rotating exhibits.  It can be even harder when travelling to a new city on a tight schedule to figure out <em>which</em> of their different museums you'd enjoy the most!  Let The Gallery curate the best pieces, exhibits, and museums, built just for you!</li>
   </ul>
