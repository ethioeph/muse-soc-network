People that plan on going to museums and enjoy art as well as museum staff will be the primary users of The Gallery. We will seek interviews with a Williams student, a member of the WCMA staff, and a visitor form the general public for this contextual inquiry. We plan on observing people at WCMA and ask about their experience while bringing up the idea of taking art outside of the museum walls. As for the WCMA staff, we will go to the museum and ask them how they would feel about putting their digital archives on our design, and about best ways to structure The Gallery in a way that supplements visits to the museum.

When it comes to finding the right person to interview, we will take the fly-on-the-wall approach. This will allow us to determine who is actually engaging with the art and who will potentially be interested in sharing their thoughts with the world. If we see someone directly looking at a piece for a long enough amount of time, we plan on going up to them and begin a conversation about it. In it, we will ask for their thoughts on the piece and take notes of their responses after we get consent to do so. Then, we will introduce The Gallery and ask about if and how they would use it. In this case, we will go from fly-on-the-wall to the apprentice approach.

When interviewing a member of the WCMA staff, we will start directly with the apprentice approach. We will ask how often people take pictures of WCMA pieces and different ways visitors share the art. Additionally, we plan on discussing our design with them and asking if it aligns with WCMAs goal and experience expectations. After hearing the staffâ€™s comments, we will write them down as adjustments to our design.
