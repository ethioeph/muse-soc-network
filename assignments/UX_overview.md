# The Gallery: A Walk Through The Gallery

# Problem and Solution Overview

Many people enjoy going to museums, but they struggle to share this experience with others.  You can go to the museum with friends, but having discussions while browsing the galleries can prove challenging.  Maybe you’d like to take those discussions elsewhere, but art doesn’t come up very often in conversation.  Further, museums get busy, and capturing a good photograph of a favourite piece can be difficult and disruptive.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a dedicated platform for: accessing digitised collections, sharing your museum experiences, and discussing art with friends and family?  When you enter The Gallery, you can find all of these conveniences on your smartphone, and take the experience everywhere you go!


# Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants

For our design research, we mostly did contextual inquiry, with a little bit of interviewing plugged in at the beginning or end of the inquiries.  Ultimately we saw this as the best option, because we knew we would benefit from the observational nature of contextual inquiries, particularly relating to museum and social media usage, but conducting brief interviews to supplement this helped us get a more complete picture.  Our participants included two Williams students and one local resident.  The students varied by demographic and interest, including a sophomore male and a senior female, one Economics major and one Political Science and English double major.  We took one student through WCMA to gather their insights on browsing museums and to follow their usage of social media throughout the museum.  The other student inquiry involved a quick interview and a walk around campus, to gather another set of information specifically about social media usage and moment sharing in life.  The final contextual inquiry, with a local, allowed us to perform a contextual inquiry in WCMA on a different age demographic (Williams student’s grandmother age group).  Our goal was ultimately to help figure out the pain-points associated with communicating in museums and sharing those experiences with others.


# Design Research Results and Themes

In our design research, we ended up completing an affinity diagram which helped bring up a few notable themes from our contextual inquiries.  These included: museum confusion, inaccessible art, social sharing, and art critique and dialogue.  Museum confusion deals with the difficulty navigating physical spaces in museums.  Inaccessible art deals with the lofty language and discussion surrounding art, which makes it hard for “casual” goers to understand.  Social sharing focuses on the ways people utilise social media to share artwork, and their thoughts about it.  Art critique and dialogue deals with the outward expression of feelings toward art.  The most common experience we noticed was everyone used their mobile camera to take pictures of their experiences and share those online with friends, a process which we see ourselves as having as opportunity to consolidate and simplify.


# Task Analysis
**Users**
In general, our users are people who attend a museum and have the desire to share art through social media. Whether the art seems odd, reminds them of a family member, or is funny, anyone would be able to be a user of our product and share their thoughts.
**Present**
Currently, people share pictures they take with their phones on social media like snapchat, instagram, and facebook. 
**Desires**
While people have some means of sharing art, they wish there was a way to share good representations of the art in a more engaging and/or personal way. There is also a desire to find similar pieces to the ones shared.
**Learned**
There’s currently no viable platform to engage in the all-encompassing dialogue, commentary, sharing, etc., that people want to get out of their museum trips. Learning to use a new platform like The Gallery should be intuitive, based on users past experience with social media platforms, sharing, etc.
**Location**
Tasks are usually performed when planning a museum visit, within the museum, or after a user’s visit. They can be performed from the convenience of a smartphone.
**Relationship**
Users can limit who can see their thoughts and comments.
**Options**
We expect users to have smartphones accessible to them. Users may also be able to reach the platform through a dedicated website rather than by using the app, so they could utilise the platform from any computer.
**Communication**
Mostly through social media platforms. The issue, however, is there is not one platform which brings together all of the people interested specifically in these conversations
**Frequency**
Ideally, these tasks are performed as often as users want. There should be no limit to how frequently users search for information or provide information to others. Performing these tasks should be organic and natural.
**Time Limits**
As people are already taking time to go to museums and sharing their thoughts on social media, transitioning to a new platform shouldn’t impose any undue time constraints on users.
**Errors**
When things go wrong (such as people not understanding contemporary dialogue surrounding art), people become disengaged. People we interviewed constantly skipped over works which seemed too abstract, which had particularly verbose wall plaques, etc., because people get frustrated, don’t understand, and often have short attention-spans.
