This is a contract that our group will adhere to this semester to make sure we function well as an unit. All three members of the group have agreed to the statements below in order to produce a good design.  

Group member sites:

[Daniel](https://ethioeph.github.io/ "Daniel's Website")

[Javi](https://javi-air.github.io/ "Javi's Website")

[Spence](https://spenny309.github.io/ "Spenny's Website")

Guiding Principles:
* Discuss conflict with the entire team
* Mandatory attendance at team meetings.  If you need to reschedule, let the team know at least 24 hours in advance
* Google Calendar is the official source for meeting times, location, etc.
* Communicate all of the issues you’re having with the group

Preliminary  Focus on Purpose:
* Develop a good product design, fitting the theme of Museum Social Networks
* Create a product all members of the team are content with

Dividing Teamwork:
* Take turns taking notes at each meeting
* Assign each team member’s roles for the following week at our weekly meeting
* Ensure all members know their role and agree to them
* Agree upon deadlines when necessary for specific tasks
* Distribute work evenly
* Emergencies happen and during some weeks an individual might need a lighter workload; It is important to communicate this with your team

Meeting Management:
* Our meetings will be held on Fridays from 4-5pm in Schow, unless otherwise noted.
* If no room is secured then we will meet in the CS common room.

Accountability Process:
* Assignments must be turned in at most two hours before the deadline and with notification to the group.

Rewards and Punishment:
* Success will be rewarded with positive team feedback and a better product.
* Failures will result in negative team feedback and a layout for adjustments.

Follow-Up:
* Contract will be revisited if it is not specific or effective enough.
