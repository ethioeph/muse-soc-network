**Problem**

Museums contain a lot of content.  Too much to even display on their walls.  And for each of those pictures, some would argue they’re worth at least 1,000 words.  Trying to look at these works and derive their meaning while browsing a museum can be difficult.  Many pieces have associated descriptions on nearby wall plaques, but one issue is that these are one-size fits all.  For the casual museum-goer, these descriptions can be too jargon-filled and academic to be easily digestible, and for the art enthusiast, they may be left wanting more than the brief four or five sentences offered in the description.  Further, it can be difficult to assess why you like certain pieces of art, and even more difficult to find other museums which host similar types of work.  As you learn more about the art world, your favourite museum, discover more, and so on, you might even love to share these new found interests and passions with your friends!  Currently, there’s no easy, all-encompassing way to solve these problems and fulfill these wants.

**Solution**

Enter: The Gallery,  a space to connect with friends and fellow museum-goers.  A place to leave ratings, comments, and opinions on artwork you’ve seen, and a place to come away with a greater understanding of the world of art around you.  When you’re traveling to a new place, you may not have time to go to all 20+ museums in the locale— but that doesn’t mean you should have to pick a few at random.  Check out museums that your friends have gone to when they visited, look into digitized galleries, and try-out recommended museums curated from the ratings you’ve given to museums you’ve already visited.  As you explore more works, become a trusted critique and share your reviews with the world!  What’s best?  You can enter The Gallery from the convenience of your phone, and take this museum-centric social media with you wherever you go!
