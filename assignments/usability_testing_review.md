# First Usability Test

The observations and results of our first Usability test can be found [here](https://ethioeph.github.io/muse-soc-network/assignments/usability_test_checkin/)

# Second Usability Test

Our second usability test was also with another Williams College student inside of our schow study room. Having noticed the effect of background noise in disrupting the focus of our participant in our first usability test we decided to conduct the second usability test in one of the small study rooms in schow where we could both hear our participantâ€™s train of thought in navigating our prototype and catching the times when our participant failed to notice some of the signifiers within the prototype that could have helped them in performing the three tasks that we had set for them. 

We introduced the three tasks: posting starry night to friends, searching for nearby recommendation and scrolling through friend and public feeds, the same way that we introduced our first usability test to standardize the results we obtain when comparing the results we obtain after the modifications we have made to the results obtained using our initial prototype. 

Critical Incidents
- Recommendation icon issue(planned to be addressed during the usability test)
  - Picking a good recommendation icon from among 6 alternatives
- Post
  - No confirmation that post has been completed
  - No warning when deleting a post.

Explainer: Javi
Computer: Spence
Notetaker: Daniel

In order to address the ambiguity of our recommendation icon from our first usability test we tried to create a host of different possible recommendation icons and asked our second usability test participant which ones they found appealing both during and at the end of our usability test.
