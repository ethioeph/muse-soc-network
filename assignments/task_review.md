# Sharing high quality photos of art on social media with commentary

Jonathan is a student who decided to visit his school museum one day. In his visit, he found a piece of art that caught his eye. What he wanted to do with this besides observing it was to share it with his family somehow. He had his phone on him, but felt uncomfortable taking time to snap a good picture of artwork on a busy day in the museum. He figured he could take a quick picture that would come out blurry. Jonathan wishes there was a way to seamlessly share art from museums in a way that does not disturb other visitors.

# Bring discussion of art outside of the museum

Monica is a chemistry professor with an affinity for art. She enjoys strolling in museums and pondering about different pieces of art. Sometimes she sees artwork that reminds her of her professional field and wishes she could have a conversation about it with colleagues. This comes difficult for her as her colleagues are not there with her to look at the art. She usually sends photos to them via text and email, but she could share more of the art’s background in order to instigate more discussion. Monica wishes she could have the discussion she wants to have outside of the museum with a way that preserves her experience of the art.

# Sharing thoughts with family and friends

Joseph is a travel sales consultant and loves to visit Art Museums after he closes deals with clients. Joseph is usually away for several weeks during his work and so wants to share pictures of the places he visits with his wife and two daughters. He particularly likes to share Art that he thinks his family will enjoy. However, he doesn’t have a good camera on his phone so his pictures end up not having the same appeal they had when he saw them in the museum. He wishes there was a way for him to get good quality images that he could attach with his well wishes for his family. 

# Recommend new art/exhibits/museums to see based on preferences

Sarah is a college student on her semester abroad in Europe. She has been trying to visit as many historical sites and museums as she can in her limited time abroad. However, she has a hard time actually finding the places that fit her particular taste in Art. In fact, she is usually frustrated when she hears about interesting art exhibitions that were happening around her only after they have come to pass. She wishes there was a way for her to get good recommendations about Art that match her preferences so she can plan her trips better and not miss good exhibitions.  

# Make art/language accessible to casual museum goers

Xavier is a young adult who enjoys going to museums.  Xavier grew up in a low-income household and didn’t attend college.  He has always loved learning about art, but didn’t have the resources to pursue this type of education growing up, and his high school didn’t offer any art or art history classes due to budget cuts in his area.  Since graduating from high school and getting a job, Xavier has had less free time to visit museums.  He tried enrolling in an art history class at his local community college to learn more about ancient Greek art.  It was going well for a while, but with increasing demands from work he didn’t have enough time to commute to and from class.  He’s now taking an online course to try to learn more about his favourite types of art, but it’s difficult to understand all of the lofty terminology without having people to explain it to him.

# Connect with new people who have similar tastes/interest

Trinity recently moved to a new city, and doesn’t have many friends yet.  They’ve been working for a couple of months and have made a few connections through work, but are looking for a group of friends with more similarities to themself.  Trinity really enjoys going to museums, but doesn’t necessarily see it as a central part of their identity.  They’ve been trying to look for new friends by: joining a book club, playing Magic at a local game store, and going out to bars.  They’re still looking for new routes through which they can meet people, however.
