_Participants and Initial Thoughts:_

Jane Williams - Our first contextual inquiry took place with Jane Williams.  She is a senior at Williams College, majoring in English and Political Science.  Our inquiry was conducted at the Williams College Museum of Art, or WCMA.  The structure of our inquiry was to follow Jane as she walked throughout the exhibits at WCMA.  We were observing her interactions with the art, particularly as they related to her use of social media when interacting with art.  This involved following Jane and stopping to ask her questions when she did certain things (such as staring at certain pieces for an extended duration, stopping to use her phone, taking photos of art, etc.).  Questions included: Why are you taking a photo of this piece?  How do you plan on sharing this piece?  What do you like about this piece?  Did you finish reading that wall plaque?

Ultimately, we learned that students such as Jane enjoy using their phones when browsing museums.  Jane was particularly fond of taking photos of the art to add to her Snapchat and Instagram accounts.  Jane didn’t have a dedicated location to share her thoughts, but she still wanted her friends to see the works, so she decided to use Snapchat and Instagram.  Jane was conflicted; while she thinks a simple picture of the art (which exists online) is boring, it feels “lame” or “narcissistic” to take a photo of herself with the art.  This is why she chooses to use Snapchat and Instagram, where she can take a photo of the art along with a typed caption.  Jane mostly took photos of 2D pieces of framed art, suggesting it is more difficult for users to capture sculptures, experimental works, and other non-visual pieces.

Caroline Miles - We spent this contextual inquiry with Caroline Miles. Caroline is the grandmother of a Williams student. She usually spends her autumns in Williamstown and enjoys going to WCMA and seeing how the exhibitions have changed. This inquiry was conducted at WCMA, where we followed Caroline as she observed different pieces in the museum. Whenever Caroline was in front of a piece of art for a longer period of time, we asked her questions about her interactions such as: why the piece caught her eye, if the wall plaque influenced her opinion of the piece, and how the piece related to the others at the museum.  After a bit of walking around, Caroline went up to a member of the staff. She wanted to know if she could take a picture in the exhibit! Then, we went in front of this dress that was showcased and she took a picture of it. After asking why she picked that dress to take a picture of, she said that she loved it and sees potential of someone wearing it nowadays. The picture itself only contained the dress, so we asked why the wall plaque was not included. She mentioned how she did not need the plaque becauses dresses are self-explanatory. We then asked what she was going to do with the picture. Caroline mentioned that it would most likely end up on Facebook, which is where she shares all her photos of art. We then learned that in her Facebook post, Caroline was going to tell her friends to check out the exhibit at WCMA along with a little paragraph about her affinity for the dress.  She does not, however, like to share art with people she doesn’t know. She did not come up with an explanation for this, but said her posts are mainly for her friends and family. 

X - Our final contextual inquiry was with X. X is a sophomore at Williams College and is planning on studying Economics. X is an avid social media user and likes that it helps him connect with friends and family who are spatially far away from him. 

Our interaction with X was divided into two sections, the first being a regular sit down interview and the second being a contextual inquiry where we walked around the Williams campus and saw the moments that prompted his interaction with social media and the moments where he chose to take pictures of things he found interesting and the thought process behind decisions to either share or not to share a specific image.  X claimed that most of the personal images as well as pictures of artwork that he usually chooses to share in the moment are ones that had an "emotional impact" or had an "aesthetic charm”.  X’s said his expectation when sharing was that others would comment on the work and possibly engage with him about the image or at least leave some kind of confirmation that it was interacted with such as a “like”, a “share” or a “retweet”. However, he also mentioned that even though his expectations might involve dialogue with his social circle, he was perfectly content sharing the image to keep people up to date on the interesting developments in his life because he enjoys viewing interesting images that others share as well.


_Affinity Diagram:_

Through our affinity diagram exercise with the data from these participants, we noted 4 primary, high-level themes that seemed worthwhile in pursuing.  There themes are: Museum Confusion, Inaccessible Art, Social Sharing and Art Critique.

* Museum Confusion: Difficulty navigating the physical space of museums.  Examples include: not knowing which direction to walk in the Dance We Must exhibit, as well as not knowing who to talk to in the museum to have questions answered

* Inaccessible Art: Refers to the general sense that casual museum-goers don’t “get” art.  Examples include: misunderstanding or becoming frustrated with jargon-filled wall plaques, and saying things like, “I don’t really get art, but I like this one because... “

* Social Sharing: Refers to modern use of social media platforms as a way to share everyday experiences.  Examples include: sharing photos of museum works to Facebook for friends and family, and sharing captioned photos to Snapchat Stories.

* Art Critique and Dialogue: The general propensity for people, regardless of experience, to express their feelings towards certain pieces of art outwardly.  Example include: telling us they like a piece of art because of its colour, or because it “looks cool,” as well as adding personal thoughts and commentary to Facebook posts of art.

Ultimately, these themes and problems point to a solution much like that described in our project proposal.  Obviously, however, we were quite biased in how we introduced the purpose of the Contextual Inquiries, which points we found worth noting, etc.  With that said, we still firmly believe that a few of the implied tasks from this exercise would be worthwhile in pursuing.  The first major task is having a dedicated platform on which people can easily share art with their friends and family.  Right now, there is no dedicated platform so users switch back and forth between a wide variety of other social media platforms, and don’t have a consolidated place to share it with the people they actually want to share it with.  The next important task is being able to interact with others and engage in dialogue about works of art.  One of the reasons why art feels so inaccessible is that current dialogue is between a casual museum-goer and a wall plaque, or perhaps a curator if one is lucky, both of which fail to describe art in a meaningful and accessible way to the casual audience.  Being able to engage with community members, friends, family, etc., about artwork will open up dialogue, and make the understanding and appreciation of artwork easier to attain.

_Task Analysis Questions:_

1. Who is going to use the design?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Anyone who: goes to museums and uses social media.  The largest user-base would likely be millenials.

2. What tasks do they now perform?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. They go to museums, they use their phones to take photos, and they share these images and clips to social media platforms, including: Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram.

3. What tasks are desired?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The ability to share these posts all in one place

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The ability to engage in dialogue with others about art

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The ability to access other, casual museum-goer’s thoughts and opinions on art

4. How are the tasks learned?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. There’s currently no viable platform to engage in the all-encompassing dialogue, commentary, sharing, etc., that people want to get out of their museum trips.  Learning to use a new platform like The Gallery should be intuitive, based on users past experience with social media platforms, sharing, etc.
  
5. Where are the tasks performed?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. These tasks can be performed from the convenience of a smartphone.  While the app should be accessible at anytime, we expect usage to be highest: when planning a trip to a museum, while at the museum, and right after users finish their visit.

6. What is the relationship between the person and data?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. This question doesn’t really make sense to us.

7. What other tools does the person have?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. We expect users to have smartphones accessible to them.  Users may also be able to reach the platform through a dedicated website rather than by using the app, so they could utilise the platform from any computer.

8. How do people communicate with each other?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. Mostly through social media platforms.  The issue, however, is there is not one platform which brings together all of the people interested specifically in these conversations

9. How often are the tasks performed?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. As noted above, we expect them to be performed mostly around the time people visit museums, so however often a user visits museums.

10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. As people are already taking time to go to museums and sharing their thoughts on social media, transitioning to a new platform shouldn’t impose any undue time constraints on users.

11. What happens when things go wrong?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  a. When things go wrong (such as people not understanding contemporary dialogue surrounding art), people become disengaged.  People we interviewed constantly skipped over works which seemed too abstract, which had particularly verbose wall plaques, etc., because people get frustrated, don’t understand, and often have short attention-spans.
